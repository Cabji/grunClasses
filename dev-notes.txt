this file is just a text file where i can save notes while i'm developing the project.

i think we have got the relationship interpretation to PEDMAS arithmetic working correctly.

next is 

switch out the GrunObject Token Letters for their numeric values
evaluate the numeric arithmetic
if the item has an _itemQuantityFormula set, 
	apply the _itemQuantityFormula to the arithmetic result
set the result to the item's _itemQuantity member.
