this file is just a text file where i can save notes while i'm developing the project.

Now we have the Spatial Values (Spatial Unit, Spatial Quantity) calculated, we need to re-do the Item Quantity calculation.

The _itemQuantity will not neccessarily always be calculated from the item's Spatial Quantity value. 
Therefore, it's probably best to just start fresh with the item's relationship string again in a function dedicated to calculating the 
item's _itemQuantity.
