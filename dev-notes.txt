this file is just a text file where i can save notes while i'm developing the project.

totalling

this is taking a set of data and grouping it by one of the fields/columns in the set and combining each group's total in another field.

therefore, we need: 
	1. a set of data
	2. the field name/location to total
	3. the field name/location to group by
	4. return a new set of data in format: set[group => total]
