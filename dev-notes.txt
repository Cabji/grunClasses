refactor class code to support vector of relationship strings in GrunItem class

use vector for GrunItem _relationship because an item COULD have multiple _relationships with its owning GrunObject

Example: N12 6000 stock bars
	Rel 1: 2L2W (ex: trimmer bars around perimeter)
	Rel 2: 3.0*1L@0.4 (ex: extra bars for slab stiffening, 3.0 long each bar at 0.4 intervals along the length)

totalling

this is taking a set of data and grouping it by one of the fields/columns in the set and combining each group's total in another field.

therefore, we need: 
	1. a set of data
	2. the field name/location to total
	3. the field name/location to group by
	4. return a new set of data in format: set[group => total]
