Capturing the significant data from a relationship's Base Expression
 /1. extract the Base Expression from the relationship (anything that occurs prior to the first @ character, if any)
 /2. regex match any GrunObject Token and * or / operator found in that base expression string [LWDAVC\/*]
 /3. remove the first result and/or last result from the matches vector if it is a / or * operator (all other operators in the matches are explicit and significant to the Spatial Unit result if they are surrounded by tokens)
 /4. convert * operators to +
 /6. convert all GrunObject Tokens to their SEV as integers (call this the numeric expression)
 7. find the token with the highest Spatial Exponent Value (SEV) in the result: call this the "Spatial Anchor"
 8. evaluate any arithmetic as required in the numeric expression to remove all + operators
 9. find the largest single integer in the resulting numeric expression
 10. compare the SEV result with the Spatial Anchor
