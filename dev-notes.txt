this file is just a text file where i can save notes while i'm developing the project.

we are now just calculating and setting the item's member values based on the item _itemQuantity

* primary labour (if there's a _primaryLabourFormula)
* item qty rounding
waste
itemized profit
etc. (just work your way through the item properties and find the best ways/places to calculate them)

probably making a new function that does all of them would be the way to go.
