Capturing the significant data from a relationship's Base Expression
 1. extract the Base Expression from the relationship (anything that occurs prior to the first @ character, if any)
 2. regex match any GrunObject Token and * or / operator found in that base expression string [LWDAVC\/*]
 3. remove the first result and/or last result from the matches vector, if it is a / or * operator (all other operators in the matches are explicit and significant to the Spatial Unit result if they are surrounded by tokens)
 4. find the token with the highest Spatial Exponent Value (SEV) in the result: call this the "Spatial Anchor"
 5. combine the Tokens' SEV in the result
   5a. if / is used, the SEV result decreases. So our final check should see if the result is lower than the Spatial Anchor
   5b. if * is used, the SEV result increases. So our final check should see if the result is higher than the Spatial Anchor
 6. compare the SEV result with the Spatial Anchor value according to which operators were used and choose the correct SEV to return
